# kNN-project

It's one of my old projects which was the first one of AI algorithms I implemented.
Deadline was close so I was in a hurry and the code isn't clean but it does the task it is supposed to do. 
So basically, firstly you can input the 'k' nearest neighbours and it will learn on training data and then compute the outcome for test data. 
There is an option to pass a new flower by typing a new vector of 4 values and prediction for it will be printed.
Big note - If for any 'k' the number of classes is the same, then it always returns the "Iris setosa".
